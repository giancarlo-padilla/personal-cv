# My Resume

I made this project to recreate my resume on a webpage, testing my CSS and HTML knowledge.   

After following along with The Odin Project and completting the basic HTML and CSS track I wanted to create something on my own.   

I did try to add some dynamic buttons to show or hide various sections but realized I didnt know anywhere close to enough about JavaScript to get it to work correctly.
